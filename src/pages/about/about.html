            Hi everybody !
            </ion-card-title>
          <p>
        
My name is Pierre Munin and I am 21 years old. It's been more than four years since I joined the IIM school at La DÃ©fense, where my desire is to improve my visual communication skills. Each week allowed me to develop a different visual idea depending on the subject imposed.   </p>
<p>The projects that I realized are as professional, academic, as personal. My professional experiences, turned to audiovisual and graphic design, allowed me to discover the functioning of a company, while creating and participating in its development.</p>
<p>My recent trips for my studies and also to discover the world have allowed me to improve my English, to meet people and especially to open myself to the world and learn new things every day. </p>
